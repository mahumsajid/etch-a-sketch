This project was used to give myself more experience with web development, focusing on blending HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to seamlessly work together.

Many components learned through The Odin Project were used here, including flexbox, DOM manipulation, and event handlers.

I initially tried to find a way to create a new grid without completely destroying the old grid. However, I quickly learned that by doing this the complexity of the Big-O Notation increased, using more memory and speed than the initial solution.
